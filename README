This is about the simplest reduction you can get for using eio_custom.

Unfortunately, it blows up on Solaris, and I can't seem to figure out why.

To run:

    node-waf configure build && node test.js

Macs and Linux are like:

    1282213843264 'before hello'
          >>>DoSomethingAsync 1 2 hello
          >>>about to eio_custom
          >>>returning
    1282213843280 'before goodbye'
          >>>DoSomethingAsync 3 4 goodbye
          >>>about to eio_custom
          >>>returning
          >>>DoSomething 6438992
          >>>sr pointer 6438960
          >>>about to sleep
          >>>DoSomething 622854192
          >>>sr pointer 622854160
          >>>about to sleep
          >>>read req, about to set result
          >>>read req, about to set result
          >>>x 1
          >>>x 3
          >>>y 2
          >>>y 4
          >>>returning
          >>>returning
          >>>DoSomething_After 6438992
    1282213845281 null 3 'hello'
          >>>DoSomething_After 622854192
    1282213845281 null 7 'goodbye'


But solaris is all:

    1282213873013 'before hello'
          >>>DoSomethingAsync 1 2 hello
          >>>about to eio_custom
          >>>returning
          >>>DoSomething 139077240
          >>>sr pointer 1024
          >>>about to sleep
    1282213873032 'before goodbye'
          >>>DoSomethingAsync 3 4 goodbye
          >>>about to eio_custom
          >>>returning
          >>>DoSomething 139077352
          >>>sr pointer 1024
          >>>about to sleep
          >>>read req, about to set result
